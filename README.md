## Description

In this project, I wanted to create a desktop game built using Web3. The goal was to connect the Metamask wallet to the game prior to playing. Once connected, users can refresh and start playing right away. The game was build using Phaser.io framework while the connectivity on backend was done by using Moralis.io. The website itself was created using NES.css framework to bring a gaming feel before playing. Must have API key and Server URL from Moralis to use code.
